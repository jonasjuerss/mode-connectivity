This repository contains various analysis in the realm of mode connectivity. It is based on the PyTorch implementation of the curve-finding and Fast Geometric Ensembling (FGE) procedures from the paper
[Loss Surfaces, Mode Connectivity, and Fast Ensembling of DNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10026)
by Timur Garipov, Pavel Izmailov, Dmitrii Podoprikhin, Dmitry Vetrov and Andrew Gordon Wilson (NIPS 2018, Spotlight).
